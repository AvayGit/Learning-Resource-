Vision

The Learning Resource Marketplace aims to revolutionize the way educational content is bought and sold by leveraging blockchain technology. This decentralized platform allows educators, content creators, and learners to interact directly, ensuring transparent and secure transactions. By eliminating intermediaries, we empower educators to receive fair compensation for their work, and learners to access quality educational materials directly from the source.

 Smart Contract

 Contract Address

- Contract Address: 0x86801805166bc91ADf19ff37F83B5BE654c1FbF3
- Network: Ethereum (Testnet/Mainnet)

 Key Features

- Resource Creation: Sellers can list their educational resources with a title, description, and price.
- Purchasing Resources: Buyers can purchase resources by sending Ether, which directly transfers ownership.
- Transparent Transactions: All transactions are logged on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and traceability.

---

 How It Works

1. Resource Creation:
   - Sellers create a new resource by providing a title, description, and price.
   - The resource is added to the marketplace, and a `ResourceCreated` event is emitted.

2. Resource Purchase:
   - Buyers select a resource and initiate a purchase by sending the required Ether.
   - The ownership of the resource is transferred to the buyer, and a `ResourcePurchased` event is emitted.
   - The seller receives the payment directly into their wallet.

3. Transaction Finality:
   - Once the resource is purchased, the transaction is final, ensuring both parties fulfill their obligations.

 Future Scope

- Decentralized Content Storage: Integrating with IPFS or another decentralized storage solution for secure, scalable content storage.
- Royalty Payments: Implementing a royalty mechanism that allows sellers to earn a percentage from future resales of their content.
- Resource Rating & Feedback: Adding features for buyers to rate resources and provide feedback to improve the quality of content.
- Cross-Chain Compatibility: Expanding the platform to support multiple blockchains for greater accessibility and lower transaction costs.
